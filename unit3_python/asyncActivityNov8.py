## Async Activity November 8th, 2024 ##
 #inside of your unit 3 folder create a new file called 

#asyncActivityNov8.py OR asyncActivityNov8.js, depending on which programming language you are learning. 
#Please follow the directions provided and answer the following questions.This will be do at the end of class. This will need to be submitted whether you are present or not. 
#Good luck.
#1. What does it "string concatenation" mean? Please write your response as a string and also provide a code example of two variables being concatenated and output the result in your terminal. 


#- if you are learning JavaScript you will be using the 
#console.log() function.
#- if you are learning Pyhon you will be using the print() function.
#2. Please list and describe three rules for creating variable names. Please provide your answer as a string.

'1.  you have a number or symbol start a varuble name.'

'2. Varible should ideally be short and descriptive.'

'3. we can format our varinbles names using camel case, snake case and  '
#3. Define each of the following variable name formats then provide a code example of how you would write them.
#- Camel case
#- Snake case
#- Pascal case
#4. Find the missing variable for each of the following assignment operaor code snippets
#***Python Version***


x=10    #10

y=2   #2

z= y*2 #4

printx > 1  z==4)
(

#***JavaScript Version***
#let a = '?'
#let b = a *b
#print(b) // the output in the terminal should be 700. 
#5. Use the logical operators and evaluate the following variables
#to get the requested result.
#***Python Version***
#- which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions are **true**. use the print function to output the result in the termial, then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.
#x= 10
#y= 2
#z= y*2
#x > 1 _____ z==4 
#***JavaScript Version***
#- which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions below are **false**. Use the console.log() function to output the result in the termial, then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.
#var x= 12
#var y= 2
#var z= 12/4
#x <= 12 _____ z < 10
